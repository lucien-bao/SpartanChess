  * They may leave Kings in check, move into check, or expose a King to check
  * Exception: Spartans may not place both Kings in duple-check.
* Hoplites may promote on their 8th rank.
  * If one of the Kings has already been taken, they may promote to a King. Otherwise they may not promote to a King.
  * Any of the other pieces can always be promoted to.
* Persians can castle but there is no en passant. Spartan kings cannot castle.
* Algebraic notation uses these letters for the Spartan pieces:
  * G General
  * W Warlord
